# Clark lab code review
## 2018-02-13

If you'd like to walk through git lesson materials that cover setting up git, creating
a repository, the add-commit cycle, how to explore your history of commits, how to ignore
certain files, how to set up a remote connection to github, how to push and pull from that
remote, how to deal with conflicts, branching, and contributing to someone else's repo, 
then check out:

We published an article in PLoS Computational Biology a few years ago that walks through
similar concepts (including a follow along tutorial that results in you contributing to
the paper's repository). Please contribute! Check it out here:

Here is a file that lists my entire command line history from the code review session,
typos and all:
